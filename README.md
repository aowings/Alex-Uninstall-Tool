# Alex-Uninstall-Tool
Nicely Uninstall Microsoft Office!

Hi! I'm created this tool mostly as a challange to myself to prove that I can do it.

The goal of this program is to walk a user step by step through the process of completely obliterating their Office installation to remove any kind of corruption or inconsistencies that may have occured. This tool will consider all of the concerns a user may have about removing their products entirely.

The program will start, The program will request administrative access as it's needed to conduct this process correctly. and open a user agreement basically stating this program only removes office 2010-2019 perpetuals, and office 365 Click to run products effectively. I do not take any liability for any unexpected results should you attempt to misuse this software, or should unexpected results arise, use at your own risk.

Accept and continue, or close and exit.

Hello! This tool is designed to help you completely remove Microsoft Office products 2010 and higher.
Please save any documents you may have open before continuing.
